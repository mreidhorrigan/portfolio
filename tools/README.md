These tools facilitate generating **multiple exam versions** and a **seating plan**. 

**Use them at** https://mreidhorrigan.github.io/portfolio/tools/MCQer.html and https://mreidhorrigan.github.io/portfolio/tools/seatPlanner.html

The tools use no databases and do everything client-side (in your browser), so have no problems that I'm aware of with data security or privacy.

This github folder provides test input files in the formats called for by the tools. You might template from the test files.
